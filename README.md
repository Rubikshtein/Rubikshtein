# Hello, world 🌍


🔎 Last year, I transitioned into the tech industry from a role as an office manager at a SaaS company, where I discovered my passion for technology and programming. 

🎓 Over the past two years, I have been dedicated to self-learning code and completed **web development** and **introduction to Python** courses through _Code First Girls_. 

👩‍💻 Currently, I am pursuing a degree in **software and data engineering** to build a solid foundation for a career in the dynamic field of technology. My goal is to leverage my skills to address real-world challenges and develop impactful solutions that make a positive difference.

🧘‍♀️ During my personal time, I focus on self-care and development by engaging in activities that nurture both my mind and body. 

📖 Reading allows me to broaden my perspectives and expand my knowledge, while practicing yoga helps me maintain balance and encourages personal growth. 

💃 Additionally, dancing serves as a creative outlet that brings me joy and motivation, closely followed by my passion for programming.
